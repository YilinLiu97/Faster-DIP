# Faster-DIP

Codebase for our paper "The Devil is in the Upsampling: Architectural Decisions Made Simpler for Denoising with Deep Image Prior"

Code for running the main CNN-based experiments shown in our paper can be found in `SelfRecon`. We additionally extend our finding / strategy to transformers. Please see `transformer-DIP`.

For now, the instructions for running the code can be found in the respective folder. We will clean the code and revise the instructions soon.
